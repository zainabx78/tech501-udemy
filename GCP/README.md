CICD OVERVIEW- 

1. DEV PUSHES CHANGE TO DEV BRANCH
2. PUSH TRIGGERS JENKINS THROUGH WEBHOOK TRIGGER.
3. JENKINS RUNS JOB 1 - MERGING THE BRANCHES (DEV TO MAIN).
4. AFTER JOB 1 IS COMPLETE, JENKINS AUTOMATICALLY RUNS JOB 2 ONLY IF JOB 1 IS SUCCESSFUL. 
5. JOB 2 = TESTING.
6. JOB 3 = PUSHING CHANGE ONTO THE ACTUAL WEBSITE. 

Credentials needed = jenkins needs github creds and jenkins needs ec2 creds that the website runs on.
